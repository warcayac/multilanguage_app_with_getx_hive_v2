# Multilanguage App with Getx and Hive (version 2)

Thanks to [@ayberkca](https://github.com/ayberkcal) I had knowledge of `appendTranslations` method, this motivated me to review the code and improve it. The code is smaller and more clear. Enjoy it!

**Note**

- `wnetworking` package is not ready to publish yet, it contains operations related to API, etc. You can replace `HttpReqService.getJson` with your typical `http.get` but keep in mind the return value and exceptions.
